## Definition of Machine-Learning:
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science and Engineering.
Machine Learing is a field of study that enables the system to learn from experience by using data.


## Goals of Machine Learning:
i) enable machine that can learn from data, make prediction and solve tasking without explicit programming.
ii)enhancing automation and decision making across various domains through pattern recognition and data-driven model.

## why Machine learning getting so mush attention recently:

i)The amount of data generation is increasing significantly and reduce the cost of sensors.  
ii)The cost of storing this data has reduced significantly.  
iii)The cost of computing has come down significantly.  
iv)Cloud has democratized compute for the masses.  
v)Notable successes in areas like:  
        image and speech recognition  
        natural language processing  
        recommendation systems  
        self-driving cars.  

These success stories demonstrate the real-world applications and potential of machine learning, driving further interest and investment in the field.
