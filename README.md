## Definition of Machine-Learning:
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science and Engineering.
Machine Learing is a field of study that enables the system to learn from experience by using data.


## Goals of Machine Learning:
i) enable machine that can learn from data, make prediction and solve tasking without explicit programming.
ii)enhancing automation and decision making across various domains through pattern recognition and data-driven model.

## Why Machine learning getting so mush attention recently:

1. The amount of data generation is increasing significantly and reduce the cost of sensors.  
1. The cost of storing this data has reduced significantly.  
1. The cost of computing has come down significantly.  
1. Cloud has democratized compute for the masses.  
1. Notable successes in areas like:  
        - image and speech recognition  
        - natural language processing  
        - recommendation systems  
        - self-driving cars.  

These success stories demonstrate the real-world applications and potential of machine learning, driving further interest and investment in the field.

## Lecture 2-3
Supervised Learning is also called Predictive Modeling. Supervised Learning is 2 types:
1. Regression: Real/Continious value predition Model. example: House price prediction.
1. Classification: Predict the class of the model. example: apple and banana class prediction, Language detection etc.

## classification:
1. Binary Classification: Classifying instances into one of two classes/categories, for example, email spam filtering (spam or not).  
1. Multiclass Classification: Classifying instances into one of three or more classes/categories, for example, color of an object, it may be red or green or blue.  
1. Multi-Label Classification: Multiple labels/classes are to be predicted for each instance, for example, when predicting a given movie category, it may belong to horror, romance, adventure, action, or all simultaneously.

## Some Classification Problems
1. Spam filtering
2. Language detection
3. Document/text classification
4. Sentiment analysis of text (positive, negative, or neutral)
5. Recognition of handwritten characters and numbers
6. Fraud detection
7. Disease prediction and detection etc.

## Regression:
Regression in supervised machine learning is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors). Its primary goal is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

### When to use regression:
<ins> Prediction:</ins> Regression is used when you want to predict a continuous output variable. For instance, predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.  

<ins>Forecasting:</ins> Regression is valuable in forecasting future trends or outcomes based on historical data patterns.  

<ins>Risk Assessment:</ins> In fields like finance and insurance, regression can be used to assess risks by predicting potential losses or gains based on various factors.  

<ins>Optimization:</ins> Regression models can also be utilized in optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best possible outcome.  

## List of Commonly Supervised Learning Algorithms  
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forest
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. Gradient Boosting Machines(GBM)
8. LightGBM
9. XGBoost
10. CatBoost
11. Neural Networks

## Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns, relationships, and structures from input data without explicit supervision or labeled responses.  
The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to explore and identify hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data.  

## Unsupervised Machine Learning Types:

1. <ins>Clustering</ins>: Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their shared characteristics or features, without predefined labels.

### application of clustering:
        - Customer Segmentation in Marketing  
        - Image Segmentation in Computer Vision  
        - Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers or anomalies in datasets, such as detecting fraudulent activities in finance.  
        - Social Network Analysis  
        - Traffic Flow Analysis
